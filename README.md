Just stumbled outta the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Last Bullet, and I swear I’m still trying to untangle whatever whirlwind just hit my brain. Walking in, I knew it was something like an action flick, maybe with a sprinkle of drama, right? But oh boy, this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 had the nerve to slap me in the face and call it a hug. Not that I’m complaining. Much. I think I might actually be more tired than entertained. 

The plot. Oh, the plot. Or was it a plot hole? Honestly, it felt like trying to make sense of my dreams after a cheese binge—chaotic and bizarre but weirdly satisfying. This main character (please, whoever wrote him, why?!) seemed shoved into every conceivable cliché but with such guts you almost start rooting for it. Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 my cat try to fit in a shoebox, you know it’s not going to work, but you can’t look away. 

And then there’s the pace. It’s like they 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed it inside a blender, and the editors just went “meh, good enough.” Everything was dizzyingly full throttle, and when it did slow down, the scenes were drenched in melodrama—way too serious for their own good. I could almost smell the tears and sweat through the screen. Who knew action heroes had so many feelings, amirite?

> On the plus side, the soundtrack! Man, it was like this sassy little spirit animal guiding the chaos. Here’s a confession: I caught myself tapping along. Embarrassing, but isn’t that what good music does? When was the last time a   score made me forget about my to-do list? I mean, forget 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , maybe I’ll just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the soundtrack and call it a day.

But I can’t talk about Last Bullet without mentioning the ending. Oh my God. Was that really the best they could do? Not gonna spoil it, but it was like getting all psyched up for a fireworks show, only for someone to hand you a sparkler. Like, thanks, but also no thanks?

So, should you run to the theater? Do your thing! Or maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at home where pausing to grab chips won’t make you miss another plot-twist-overload. Anyway, as for me? I’m heading home to un-roller-coaster my brain; maybe a nap? Or a drink? Or both.
